# CarBaMa-Automotive-Sale-Application

"CarBaMa" is a software application designed and developed as the final project of the Software Engineering 1 undergraduate course. The project aimed to create a comprehensive automotive car sale application that encompasses various tools and ideas to provide a seamless user experience. The main focus of the course, by the way, was to develop an application based on the waterfall model, following the standard steps of the software development cycle.

The project began with a thorough requirements gathering phase to identify the needs and expectations of the application. We generated various documents, such as use cases, activity diagrams, class diagrams, sequences, and communication diagrams, to better understand the functional and non-functional requirements of the application.

We also created a proposal that outlined the project's objectives, scope, timeline, and budget. The proposal provided a detailed overview of the application, including its features, user interface, and technical specifications.

Then we jump into the design and development phases of the project. The design phase involved creating a user-friendly interface that would enable users to easily search, view, and purchase cars. We used Adobe XD to create a visually appealing and intuitive design that met the requirements of the stakeholders. In the development phase, the database was created with TSQL using Microsoft SQL Server, which was used to store and manage the data for the application.

In addition to the following, there were other sorts of documents in this repository that supported our work to deliver a high-quality software product in a standard software engineering procedure!
